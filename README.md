I was for this assigment set by the University of South Wales tasked with developing a WinForm program using C# as a front end for a mySQL database that was provided. The application is to be used by managers of the bank, so should present functions useful for an Accounts Manager working at the bank. Marks will be awarded based of the technical complexity of tasks undertaken, the quality of your C# coding, and the design and ease of use of the interface developed.

<h2 align="left">Description</h1>

<h3 align="left">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Allow the manager to select any open issue ISA product and change its status to closed.</li>
<li>Allow the manager to list all customers in order of their remaining tax year deposit allowance.</li>
<li>Allow the manager to alter the interest rate paid on a selected ISA product.</li>
<li>Allow the manager to run the overnight calculation for accrued interest for all accounts. The formula is: Accrued Interest = Accrued Interest + (Balance * Account Annual Interest Rate / 365.0)</li>
<li>Allow the manager to run the end of tax year updates to the database. All account balances should be updated with accrued interest; the accrued interest should then be reset to zero and the customerâ€™s deposit allowances reset.</li>
<li>Implemented a simple encryption to the database for security as well as a login form for admins.</li>
<li>Implemented a notification circle on the main form to allow the manager to know how many products are still open.</li>
